# Imran Ali — Resume (GitHub Pages)

This repository contains a clean, responsive resume site intended to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

Files:
- `index.html` — main resume page (Bootstrap + custom CSS)
- `style.css` — custom styles and print rules
- `script.js` — theme toggle and reveal animation scripts
- `profile.jpg` — profile photo (place your image here)
- `Resume-Imran-Ali.pdf` — PDF version of your resume (place production PDF here)

Quick setup for GitHub Pages:
1. Create a repository named `<yourusername>.github.io` and push this project to the repository root.
2. Ensure `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `profile.jpg`, and `Resume-Imran-Ali.pdf` are committed.
3. Wait a few minutes and visit `https://<yourusername>.github.io`.

Notes:
- The site uses a Bootstrap CDN; if you prefer to bundle assets, download Bootstrap and update the link in `index.html`.
- The theme toggle persists the user's preference in `localStorage`.
- The page includes print-friendly styles to produce a clean PDF when printing from the browser.

If you want I can:
- Further tune copy to match a specific job posting.
- Generate a ready-to-print PDF from the page.
- Add a LinkedIn/GitHub link section if you provide the URLs.
